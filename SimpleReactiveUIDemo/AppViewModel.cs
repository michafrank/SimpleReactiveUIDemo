        // and "pipe" them to a Property - whenever the Observable yields a new
        // value, we will notify ReactiveObject that the property has changed.

        // To do this, we have a class called ObservableAsPropertyHelper - this

        // lets the user know that the app is busy). We also declare this property

            //
            // We're going to use the Throttle operator to ignore changes that 
            // happen too quickly, since we don't want to issue a search for each 
            // key pressed! We then pull the Value of the change, then filter 
            // out changes that are identical, as well as strings that are empty.
            //
            // Finally, we use RxUI's InvokeCommand operator, which takes the String 
            // and calls the Execute method on the ExecuteSearch Command, after 
            // making sure the Command can be executed via calling CanExecute.

             * succinctly; the code to implement "The UI spinner spins while the search

             *
             * However, with RxUI, we can describe how properties are related in a very 
             * organized clear way. Let's describe the workflow of what the user does in
             * this application, in the order they do it.
